<h1>Hi, I'm Max</h1>

<p>I’m a front-end software engineer, dad, and amateur gardener. I enjoy coding, spending time with my family, and cultivating my garden.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<h3>Current Role</h3>

I'm a senior front-end software engineer and service architect at Mastercard. My work focuses on designing and engineering web applications, SDKs, and front-end microservices for Mastercard’s Click to Pay / Unified Checkout Solutions products.

<h3>Background</h3>

Originally, I studied English literature in college. After a decade in retail management, I decided to switch careers. I enrolled in Flatiron School's software engineering bootcamp and upon graduating, joined the school as an instructor and then curriculum writer. Over time, I advanced to senior curriculum designer, software engineer, and eventually, curriculum manager before transitioning to a senior software engineering role at Mastercard.

<h3>Things I've Worked On</h3>

For the past few years, I have mainly worked on [Mastercard's Unified Checkout Solution](https://developer.mastercard.com/unified-checkout-solutions/documentation/) for online retailers and payment service providers. As part of this work, I've helped launch and maintain core components of UCS, including:

- [Click to Pay](https://developer.mastercard.com/unified-checkout-solutions/documentation/use-cases/click-to-pay/), a JavaScript SDK that provides a 'card on file' checkout experience. This product used by businesses in 35 countries and provides a secure, streamlined checkout experience for millions of transactions a year.

- [Installments at Checkout](https://developer.mastercard.com/unified-checkout-solutions/documentation/use-cases/mastercard-installments-at-checkout/), an embeddable web application for connecting online shoppers to lenders. Currently available at [Shop.com](https://www.shop.com/).
- [Mastercard's Web Components suite](https://src.mastercard.com/srci/integration/components/index.html?path=/story/components-src-otp-input--src-otp-input) for helping businesses build a checkout experience on their own checkout pages.
- [Mastercard's Checkout Solution](https://developer.mastercard.com/mastercard-checkout-solutions/documentation/) for payment service providers interested in using [Secure Remote Commerce](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/secure-remote-commerce/), a set of API and SDK specifications for common integration patterns for Mastercard, Visa, Amex, and Discover card services.

Before Mastercard, I worked on [Flatiron School's Open-Source Software Engineering Curriculum](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum), used in the school's [software engineering immersive and online bootcamps](https://flatironschool.com/welcome-to-flatiron-school/), [Amazon's Career Choice Program](https://flatironschool.com/blog/amazon-career-choice-program-2021-results/), and [re:coded](https://www.re-coded.com/).

<h3>Skills and Technologies</h3>

- Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS
- Frameworks/Libraries: React, Vue.js, Rails
- Tools: Git, Webpack, Playwright, Jenkins
- Methodologies: Agile, Scrum, CI/CD

<h3>Personal Interests</h3>

When I'm not coding, I'm trying to build a perennial garden. This year, I’ve planted sunchokes, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, forsythia, comfrey, and lungwort.
