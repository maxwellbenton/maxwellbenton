<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

### Current Work

I currently work as a senior front-end software engineer / service architect at Mastercard, where I design and engineer the web applications, SDKs, and front-end microservices that make up Mastercard’s Click to Pay / Unified Checkout Solutions products.

### My Background

I studied English literature in college, but after struggling to break into the writing industry, I spent ten years working to build a career in fast-paced retail management, leading customer service departments in some of the world's busiest grocery stores. I consider my time working with the public and leading large teams to be a great secondary education and I apply the skills I learned daily.

In 2016, I worked my way to a regional management position, but felt it was time for a change. I saved up a bit of money and decided to take a risk. I quit my job and signed up for Flatiron School's software engineering bootcamp. After graduating, I joined the school as an instructor, then moved into a curriculum writer position, writing and maintaining the school's educational content. I continued to move up, becoming a senior curriculum designer, then software engineer, and finally, the school's curriculum manager. Not long after, I had the opportunity to join Mastercard in my first senior software engineering role.

In my free time, I am trying to build a perennial garden and food forest at my home. This year, I planted sunchokes, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, forsythia, comfrey, and lungwort.
