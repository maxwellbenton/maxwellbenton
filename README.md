<h2>About Me</h2>

### Current Role

I'm a senior front-end software engineer and service architect at Mastercard. My work focuses on designing and engineering web applications, SDKs, and front-end microservices for Mastercard’s Click to Pay / Unified Checkout Solutions products.

### Background

Originally, I studied English literature in college. After a decade in retail management, I decided to switch careers. I enrolled in Flatiron School's software engineering bootcamp and upon graduating, joined the school as an instructor and then curriculum writer. Over time, I advanced to senior curriculum designer, software engineer, and eventually, curriculum manager before transitioning to a senior software engineering role at Mastercard.

### Things I've Worked On

- The launch and maintenance of [Mastercard's Unified Checkout Solution](https://developer.mastercard.com/unified-checkout-solutions/documentation/) for online retailers and payment service providers and [Mastercard's Installments at Checkout](https://developer.mastercard.com/unified-checkout-solutions/documentation/use-cases/mastercard-installments-at-checkout/)
- [Mastercard's UCS Web Components suite](https://src.mastercard.com/srci/integration/components/index.html?path=/story/components-src-otp-input--src-otp-input)
- [Mastercard's Checkout Solution](https://developer.mastercard.com/mastercard-checkout-solutions/documentation/) for [Secure Remote Commerce](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/secure-remote-commerce/)
- [Flatiron School's Open-Source Software Engineering Curriculum](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum)

### Skills and Technologies

- Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS
- Frameworks/Libraries: React, Vue.js, Rails
- Tools: Git, Webpack, Playwright, Jenkins
- Methodologies: Agile, Scrum, CI/CD

### Personal Interests

When I'm not coding, I'm trying to build a perennial garden. This year, I’ve planted sunchokes, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, forsythia, comfrey, and lungwort.
